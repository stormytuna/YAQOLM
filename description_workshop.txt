[b]Yet Another Quality of Life Mod[/b] is, unsurprisingly, yet another quality of life mod. It aims to provide a variety of quality of life features and tweaks that would't necessarily fit in vanilla.

Some things this changes are adding recipes to items that are hard to acquire (looking at you Rod of Discord), allowing bombs to destroy tiles you can mine, a magnet that works from your inventory and lets you pull items in the world to you and a whole lot more.

Don't like something I've changed? That's fine, you can disable every single feature of this mod independently of each other.
