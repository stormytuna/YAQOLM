Yet Another Quality of Life Mod is, unsurprisingly, yet another quality of life mod. It aims to provide a variety of
quality of life features and tweaks that would't necessarily fit in vanilla.

Some things this changes are adding recipes to items that are hard to acquire, allowing bombs to destroy tiles you can
mine, a magnet that works from your inventory and lets you pull items in the world to you and a whole lot more. For a
full list of changes and features, see the Workshop description

Don't like something I've changed? That's fine, you can disable every single feature of this mod independently of each
other.
